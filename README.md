identifier-to-identifier mapping using graphs 

Inter–conversion of different types of identifiers is a ubiquitous feature of bioinformatics work flows. However practicalities of dealing with many–to– many, many–to–one, or one–to–many relationships among different identi- fiers remains complicated. Here, I describe a simple, generic approach for dealing with relationships between two sets of different identifiers, based on the use of graphs. The approach is implemented in R and a package is provided in 'identifier.mapping_1.0.tar.gz'. More detailed documentation will follow.
