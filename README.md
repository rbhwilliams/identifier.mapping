# identifier.mapping
Inter–conversion of different types of identifiers is a ubiquitous feature of bioinformatics work flows. However practicalities of dealing with many–to–many, many–to–one, or one–to–many relationships among different identifiers can get complicated. This R package provides a simple, generic approach for dealing with such relationships between two sets of different identifiers, based on the use of graphs. The package is provided in 'identifier.mapping_1.0.tar.gz'. More detailed documentation will follow.
